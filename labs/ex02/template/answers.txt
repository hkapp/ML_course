1)
  i) Each column is a data point (with the added '1' value to simplify the arithmetic)
  ii) Each row is a feature. In our case, the 'empty' feature, then the height
  iii) cf i.
  iv) y : 3x1, x : 3x2. X_32 is the height of the third person

  a) L(w) = 1/2N * eTe

2)
  b) Not a good estimate, the line going through the middle appears to be to low.
     The problem is that MSE is not good in this case, errors for higher weights are more imptcful
     With 50, much better, but still not perfect
  c) fine grid obviously
     ofc, with finer grid, results are better, but it takes a longer time to compute

3) L(w) = 1/2N * sum_n(yn - xnTw)^2
        = 1/2N * sum_n(yn - w0 - w1 * xn1)^2
   Ln(w) = 1/2 * (yn - w0 - w1 * xn1)^2
   dLn(w) / dw0 = 1/2 * 2 * -1 * (yn - w0 - w1 * xn1)
                = w0 + w1 * xn1 - yn
